The story had held us, round the fire, sufficiently breathless, but except the o
bvious remark that it was gruesome, as, on Christmas Eve in an old house, a stra
nge tale should essentially be, I remember no comment uttered till somebody happ
ened to say that it was the only case he had met in which such a visitation had 
fallen on a child. The case, I may mention, was that of an apparition in just su
ch an old house as had gathered us for the occasion—an appearance, of a dreadf
ul kind, to a little boy sleeping in the room with his mother and waking her up 
in the terror of it; waking her not to dissipate his dread and soothe him to sle
ep again, but to encounter also, herself, before she had succeeded in doing so, 
the same sight that had shaken him. It was this observation that drew from Dougl
as—not immediately, but later in the evening—a reply that had the interestin
g consequence to which I call attention. Someone else told a story not particula
rly effective, which I saw he was not following. This I took for a sign that he 
had himself something to produce and that we should only have to wait. We waited
 in fact till two nights later; but that same evening, before we scattered, he b
rought out what was in his mind.
